# ASCIIRenderer

This is a simple ASCII renderer I wrote in C#. It takes an image and converts it to ASCII art.
However, It can do this in <span style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #ff0000, #7F00FF); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">Color</span>!

## Installation

To install, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gammer0909/ASCIIRenderer.git
```

Then, make sure you have the .NET SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

## Usage

Usage of this program (As of currently, 11/25/23) you must edit the code in `src/Program.cs`. You can change the image path, the font size, and the output path. Then, run the program using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Hopefully I'll add a CLI soon.
